E9 P4 - TOPICS

## Is it mandatory to begin a file name and hook name begins with "use"

> Not mandatory to keep the file name of a custom hook to begin with "use" but it is recommended
> Maintainable, other developers know its a hook if we give the name as "use"
> Same for a component name, it should begin with a capital letter
> linter - will throw an error if we dont have it in the right way
> if we give "use" - the person reading will know it is a custom hook which has its own state, life cycle etc
