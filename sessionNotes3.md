## Using Tailwindcss

> We are going to put css using "classnames" for every css
> GIving our head classname as "flex"
> Decrease the with of the image - "w-8" -> gives the width
> p-8 -> padding on all sides
> flex -> flexes the item
> m-4 -> gives a margin
> Super power while using taildwindcss - Tailwind CSS intelliSense (Extension for VS Code)
> sm - small, md -medium, lg - large, xl - extra large
> px -> padding to left and right together
> For custom values we use it inside [] i.e w-[200px] // dynamic classes
> Tailwind also gives us pre-built components
> Comes with the initial learning curve, and makes the code look ugly
> It is very light weight (parcel includes only the css what is being used)
